# Cormorant
CORMORANT is an extensible, risk-aware, multi-modal, crossdevice authentication framework that enables transparent
continuous authentication using different biometrics across multiple trusted devices.

# Please note
CORMORANT is currently under development and far from being mature. APIs are thus subject to change and not yet considered stable. In case you wan't to work with or contribute to this project, make sure to contact one of the contributors.
